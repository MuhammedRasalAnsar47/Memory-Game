Memory Game - React


## Description
The Memory Game is a classic card-matching game built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. In this game, players are challenged to match pairs of cards with identical icons by clicking on them. Upon clicking, the card flips, revealing an icon, and the player aims to find its matching pair by flipping another card. If the icons match, the cards remain flipped, indicating a successful match. However, if the icons do not match, both cards flip back over, and the player continues to search for matching pairs.
